Single Player -or- 1st Person

                Game loop
Death Trap: Maze, with bunch of traps that requires quick thinking + Monsters Demons
    Choices for paths ex: Bottomless Pit vs Giant Bees have 10 seconds and have weapons and/or abilities to better decide which path to take. Right to Left
                    +
                Story/Narrative 
World peace: Time travel to times, solve problems with limited time, otherwise trapped in that
     time zone. 
Goal: World Peace & get back to the present. (?) 



            Smaller Ideas / logic

    Nothing is entirely random, Example:   if you chose to go through a cave with snakes, the player will have a guide button so the know how much damage the snakes will do. 
There will be between 3 and 5 backgrounds. 

        Enemies

Snakes will deal 5 damage to the players 100 hp listed at the top left of the screen. And the snake will only deal damage if the player gets too close ( it's a small radius). If the player is holding a dead daisies rat in there inventory they can press the use button and that will permanently disable the snake from attacking the user. 2X SMALLER ,SMALL RATTLE SOUND

        Thug/bandit/bad human, the ai of the thug will be “random” aka some will attack and others will do nothing. The thug will deal 10 damage to the player every 3 seconds and the hp of the thug will be 30.SAME SIZE GRUNTS OR NOISES THAT HUMANs make when fighting. 

        Giant eagle (boss), the giant egal will deal 30 damage to the player every 10 seconds with swift blows the eagle will spawn less often than the other enemies and only appears in the past dimension and will have 120 hp. WILL BE 2X BIGGER THAN THE PLAYER.Egal cry every minute or so.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            WEAPONS/Items
    The max carry capacity will be 10 items and the weapons will only consist of 2 being the sword dealing 30 damage to opponents, one striking most enemies 
                                
           

    Controls
